    <p> My idea of robotics changed because now I'm able to clearly identify what a robot is and how to define it. 
    Also now when I think about robots I'm not exactly just thinking about a program that talks back or has artificial intelligence
    but a program that's able to carry out tasks automatically. I'm excited to see the innovation robots will
    encounter to help people with disabilities or to help improve people's lives. I'm not really nervous about anything 
    concerning robots right now. For circuits, being able to make a series circuit worked well but we could work better on
    figuring out how to do more extensions such as a parallel circuit. </p>

    <p> The common thing about Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard have in common is that they're both notable computer scientist
    who work with robots specifically. They both work with robots that have movement and experience with playing around
    and working to help people. My team worked together in bulding our lightshow by combining all of our ideas and taking turns
    implementing them through writing the code. We took turns building the circuit/code and while we weren't directly working
    with the wires/computers, we were giving our input to help improve the program. Our teamwork could've improved if we 
    weren't all lacking sleep and were a bit more energetic while working. The basic pieces in every Arduino sketch are pinmode, 
    digital write and delay. </p>
