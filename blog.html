    <p> My idea of robotics changed because now I'm able to clearly identify what a robot is and how to define it. 
    Also now when I think about robots I'm not exactly just thinking about a program that talks back/ or has artificial intelligence
    but just a program that's able to carry out tasks automatically. I'm excited to see the innovation robots will
    encounter to help people with disabilities or to help improve people's lives. I'm not really nervous about anything 
    concerning robots right now. For circuits, being able to make a series circuit worked well but we could work better on
    figuring out how to do more extensions such as a parallel circuit. </p>
