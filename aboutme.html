    <h3> Fun Fact: When I attended elementary school in Oakland, I went to an after school program that had elective
      classes and for 2 years I did an African drum, dance and xylophone class. We even did a performance at The
      Oakland Zoo! (Is this fun enough for a fun fact?)</h2>
    
    <h2 class="double"> Biography </h2>
     <p> Hello! I'm Bella. I was born and raised in Oakland for the first 8 years of my life and have been living 
       in San Leandro ever since. I'm a first generation Chinese American and an incoming senior at San Lorenzo High School.
       I have two older sisters and we all have names that start with a B (Bella, Beijo & Betsy).
       I've been playing tennis for 4 years (this incoming school year will be my 3rd year as captain and singles 1 of my
       school's varsity team). I enjoy learning about our environment and being an advocate for protecting our
       precious planet, hence my 6 month internship at EarthTeam, a non-profit organization teaching youth about environmental
       sustainability and career exploration in STEM. I also enjoy doing film/digital media projects! This incoming school year I will
       be taking my 4th media production class as a part of my school's 4-year-long career exploration film program called Bay
       Area Digital Arts (BADA). Because of BADA, I've been an anchor for my school's weekly annoucement broadcast 
       (previously a director), made various types of video projects (PSA, documentary, music video, short film, news segments, etc)
       and have just been completely and unexpectedly influenced into creating my own projects on YouTube (you can find the link to
       my channel down below on my fav websites! :-)).
