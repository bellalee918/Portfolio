    <h3> Fun Fact: When I attended elementary school in Oakland, I went to an after school program that had elective
      classes and it was there where I did an African drum, dance and xylophone class for 2 years. We even did a performance at 
      Oakland Zoo. (Is this fun enough for a fun fact?)</h2>

       Oakland for the first 8 years of my life and have been living in San Leandro ever since. </p>
